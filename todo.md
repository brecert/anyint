- [x] Better type support so that `let x: int<i32, 2> = int::from_lossy(5);` works
  If `from_lossy` and similar is to remain const, other features may need to be implemented first like const fn in traits
- [ ] A macro for writing int, so that `let x = n!(16u7);` is possible
- [ ] More methods
- [ ] A more generic implementation once rust has better type support for that
- [ ] FromStr and other implementations
- [ ] A Wrapped implementation
- [x] const fn in traits once rust supports that
- [ ] feature flags
- [ ] bigints or similar
- [ ] better docs and doctests
- [ ] every one of these is fufilled: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html
- [ ] very heavy cleanup
  - [ ] test normalization and cleanup
  - [ ] split up lib.rs
- [ ] add benchmarks
