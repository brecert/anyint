- [ ] Better type support so that `let x: int<i32, 2> = int::from_lossy(5);` works
- [ ] A macro for writing int, so that `let x = n!(u7);` is possible
- [ ] More methods
- [ ] A more generic implementation once rust has better type support for that
- [ ] FromStr and other implementations
- [ ] A Wrapped implementation
- [ ] const fn in traits once rust supports that
- [ ] feature flags
- [ ] bigints or similar
